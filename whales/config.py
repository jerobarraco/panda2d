#I'm very sorry but this might vary a lot
#VOLUME is the threshold for the noise in the mic, you will have to play with this
# In theory it should work, and in theory if you mess with it, it won't break the whole
# "game" (like it's not broken now). But i can't promise that sorry.
# default:
# VOLUME = 130.0
VOLUME = 130.0


#MAX_FREQ defines the maximum frequency in Hertz. in Theory mess with this if you can't make
#high freq noises, or if you can't affect certain whales, or if you mic sux or rox
# Same warning as for volume, shouldnt break anything, should fix something, no promises
# default:
# MAX_FREQ = 800.0
MAX_FREQ = 800.0
