	Example game made in <1 day for the global game jam 2017.
	It is rushed, hacky and not academic.
	Credits goes to :

		Jeronimo Barraco Marmol -> coding
		Nicholas Oliveira -> coding and awesomeness
		Code available here -> https://bitbucket.org/jerobarraco/panda2d

	Yes this is full of dirty hacks :)

	requires pyaudio
	requires numpy

	install them with pip install pyaudio and pip install numpy

	to use pip with panda (on windows) get the "get_pip.py" and run it with
	"ppython".
	on linux you can install panda3d, pyaudio and numpy from the package manager (yeah baby!)

	Oh and the process might get stuck and youll have to kill it, so i recommend running it on a terminal
