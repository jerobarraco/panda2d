How to play:
- Use your mic (and configure it (pavucontrol))
- Talk, sing or anything to the whales, each one likes its own frequency though
- But don't make too much noise or the whalehunters might hear us

After "Hatoful Boyfriend" heres comes the best animal love simulator ever

Being a whale is not easy, please help protecting them http://www.internationalwhaleprotection.org


	Example game made in <1 day for the global game jam 2017.
	It is rushed, hacky and not academic.

		Jeronimo Barraco Marmol -> coding

	Yes this is full of dirty hacks :)

	requires pyaudio
	requires numpy

	install them with pip install pyaudio and pip install numpy

	to use pip with panda (on windows) get the "get_pip.py" and run it with
	"ppython".
	on linux you can install panda3d, pyaudio and numpy from the package manager (yeah baby!)

	Oh and the process might get stuck and youll have to kill it, so i recommend running it on a terminal
